\## State Machine Project

This project demonstrates a simple embedded state machine
implemented in C using modular design principles.

The goal is to showcase clean structure, state-based logic,
and separation between interface and implementation.

\## Architecture

\- main.c: Application entry point and main loop

\- system.h: State definitions and function declarations

\- system.c: State machine implementation

\## State Flow

INIT → IDLE → ACTIVE → ERROR

\## Notes

This project is implemented in standard C
