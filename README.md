\# Embedded C State Machine Project



\## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple embedded-style state machine

implemented in C using modular design principles.



The goal is to showcase clean structure, state-based logic,

and separation between interface and implementation.



\## Architecture

\- main.c: Application entry point and main loop

\- system.h: State definitions and function declarations

\- system.c: State machine implementation



\## State Flow

INIT → IDLE → ACTIVE → ERROR



\## Notes

This project is implemented in standard C and simulates

embedded system behaviour without hardware dependencies.
